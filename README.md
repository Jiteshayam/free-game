# Free Game

Free Game is a React project that uses the Freetogame API to help users find and play free games. The project has a simple UI with categories for different types of games, a search bar, and a list of top games. Users can browse the games by category or search for a specific game. When a user clicks on a game, they will be taken to a game official site.
